## How to use the App
When you start the app you will be prompted with a screen that asks you to log in or to register. If you do not have an account yet you will need to register first.
After registering you will need to log in. After you are logged in you will be promted with with three choices Zone, Category, and Device on the left hand side of the screen. In each of these you will be able to add, edit, preview, and delete entries from the database as you would see fit.
